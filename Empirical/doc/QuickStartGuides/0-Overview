The goal of Empirical is to simplify the development of efficient, reliable, and accessible
scientific software.

We have several quick-start guides for different portions of the code.

Getting started:
* Using specific header files is simple, just #include them into your own project.  We
  recommend adding your Empirical/source/ folder to the include directories for your C++
  compiler (usually with the -I option).
* To use the web features in Empirical, you must first install the Emscripten compiler,
  which can be slightly more complicated.
